# Mini Monkey
Mini Monkey is a platformer with a swinging movement mechanic. It has been an enjoyable project that was more complex than I had originally thought. This Godot 2D Game is hosted on [Itch.io](https://mumfordd.itch.io/mini-monkey) and can be played by anyone.

## Future updates

There is still more that I would like to add to the game such as more levels, level selection, a better defined swing mechanic and level interactables. I do not have current plans to make these updates but think they would make great additions to this project.
